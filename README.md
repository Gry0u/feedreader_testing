# Feed Reader testing

Given a [starter](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) code of a web-based application that read RSS feeds, tests were implemented to check the application's functionalities and behavior.

## Get Started
- clone or download this repository.
- open [index.html](./index.html) in your browser to see the tests results.

## Tests performed
- The name and URL of each feed are defined and not empty.
- The hamburger menu behaves properly: hidden by default, visibility toggled on click.
- Some initial entries are loaded.
- New different entries are loaded when a different feed is selected.

## Resources
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) framework used for JavaScript testing.
- [Forked repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) for starter code.
